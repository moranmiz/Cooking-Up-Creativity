Title: Slippery Dumplings

Ingredients:
1 cup white flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 12 teaspoons shortening

Directions:
Place dry ingredients in a bowl.
Mix dry ingredients.
Cut shortening into dry ingredients.
Add water slowly, just enough to make a stiff dough.
If the dough is tacky, add a small amount of flour until it is stiff.
Roll dough out very thinly, about 1/2 centimeter thick.
With a sharp knife cut the dough into small squares, about 1 1/2 inch wide by 2 inches high.
