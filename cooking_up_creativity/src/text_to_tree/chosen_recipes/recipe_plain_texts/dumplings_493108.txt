Title: Prune dumplings (pierogi) recipe

Ingredients:
3 tbsp butter, for melting and pouring over dumplings
4 prunes, sliced, to decorate
1 handful sprigs of thyme, to decorate
200 g (7.1oz) plain flour
150 g (5.3oz) buttermilk
1 pinch salt
100 g (3.5oz) pearl barley
100 g (3.5oz) prunes
120 g (4.2oz) cottage cheese
1 tbsp finely chopped fresh thyme

Directions:
Mix the flour with buttermilk and knead together until its combined.
Let it rest for 30 minutes.
Cook the pearl barley according to the instructions on the box or packet (it should double its volume after cooking).
Chop the prunes.
Chop fresh thyme very finely.
Mix the two together and then add the cottage cheese.
The filling can be sprinkled with salt, keeping in mind that cottage cheese is naturally slightly salty in taste.
The dough with this recipe is flexible and can easily be rolled out very thinly.
Even when the dough is rolled out thinly, the dumplings remain flexible.
For one dumpling, use one teaspoon of filling.
Boil a pan of lightly salted water and put the dumplings in, cooking for 2 minutes until the dumplings float and are no longer doughy.
Serve the dumplings on a plate, pour on the melted butter and decorate with pieces of prunes and fresh thyme.
Enjoy your meal!
