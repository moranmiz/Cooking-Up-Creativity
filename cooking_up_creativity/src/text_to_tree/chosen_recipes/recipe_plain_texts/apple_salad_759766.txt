Title: Celery Root & Apple Salad

Ingredients:
A 2-pound whole celery root, rinsed well but not peeled
1 pound firm, crisp apples (see above for varieties)
3 tablespoons cider vinegar
1 tablespoon German-style mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives
A large bowl for dressing, tossing, and serving

Directions:
Put the celery root in a large saucepan with cold water to cover, and heat to a boil.
Lower the heat a bit, and simmer the celery root for about an hour or so, until cooked through and tender.
As it cooks, keep the root submerged by weighting it with a plate or pot lid.
When you can easily pierce the celery root with a skewer, drain it in a colander and cool.
To peel the celery root: scrape off the skin with the dull side of a paring knife, and cut out the bits of skin in the folds and any tough, knobby parts.
Cut the celery root in half, and slice each half into thin half-moons; put these in the large bowl.
(If the celery root is a bit fibrous, cut the slices into thin matchsticks.)
Rinse the apples well, but dont peel them.
Slice them in half, through the stem and bottom ends, and cut out the seeds and cores.
Slice the halves crosswise into half-moons, about 1/8 inch thick, add to the bowl, and gently toss the celery root and apple slices together.
For the dressing: whisk together the vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper in a small bowl, then whisk in the olive oil gradually, until smooth and emulsified.
Pour the dressing over the celery root and apple, sprinkle the chives on top, and tumble to coat all the slices with dressing.
Serve at room temperature.
