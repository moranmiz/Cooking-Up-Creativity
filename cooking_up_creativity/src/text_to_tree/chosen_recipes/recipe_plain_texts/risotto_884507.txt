Title: Spanakopita Risotto

Ingredients:
6 cups chicken stock
14 cup olive oil
4 scallions, green & white parts chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 cup arborio rice or 1 cup carnaroli rice
12 cup dry white wine
1 teaspoon dried dill
6 ounces fresh Baby Spinach
12 cup feta cheese, crumbled (plus extra)
1 tablespoon lemon juice
salt & pepper

Directions:
Heat stock in a saucepan over medium heat; keep at a low simmer.
Heat olive oil in a heavy bottomed saucepan over medium heat.
Saute scallions until soft.
Add garlic and cook another 2 minutes.
Add rice and cook, stirring constantly, until rice begins to make a clicking sound like glass beads (about 3-4 minutes).
Add wine and dill to the rice mixture, and stir until the wine is absorbed.
Using a ladle, add 3/4 cup hot stock to the rice.
Stir constantly at a moderate speed.
When rice mixture is just thick enough to leave a clear wake behind the spoon, add another 3/4 cup stock.
Continue adding stock 3/4 cup at a time until all 6 cups have been added.
The final mixture should be thick enough that the grains of rice are suspended in liquid the consistency of heavy cream.
It will thicken upon standing.
Remove from heat.
Stir in spinach, feta, and lemon juice, mixing until the spinach is wilted and the feta is melty.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Top individual servings with extra feta if desired.
