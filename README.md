2. Install dependencies:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```


## CODE
[TBD] 


## DATA 

### DishCOVER Dataset
The `data/` folder contains a zipped directory named `DishCOVER_dataset`, which includes the DishCOVER dataset: ~5K recipes generated using our algorithm, formatted as JSON.
This zipped folder contains two files:
* `DishCOVER_dataset_core.json` – includes only the essential information for each generated recipe
* `DishCOVER_dataset_extended.json` - includes additional fields that may be useful for deeper analysis


Each entry in the core dataset follows this structure:

```json
"4": {
  "dish_pair": "apple_cake_to_banana_bread",
  "full_recipe_text": "Title: Caramel Banana Spice Cake\n\n Ingredients: ...\n\n Instructions: ...",
  "recipe_summary": "Caramel Banana Spice Cake is a decadent dessert featuring layers of banana bread, spiced cake, and rich caramel flavors...",
  "recipe_novelty_score": 77.439,
  "picked_1st_exp": false, 
  "picked_2nd_exp": false
}
```
Each key corresponds to the index of a recipe.
* `dish_pair`: the pair of source dishes (e.g., apple cake and banana bread)
* `full_recipe_text`: the complete generated recipe (title, ingredients, instructions)
* `recipe_summary`: a short summary of the recipe generated by the LLM
* `recipe_novelty_score`: the novelty score of the recipe elements (ingredients and actions), computed as described in the paper
* `picked_1st_exp` / `picked_2nd_exp`: booleans indicating whether this recipe was sampled for either of the evaluation experiments


Each entry in the extended dataset includes all core fields, plus additional information:

```json
"4": {
  "dish_pair": "apple_cake_to_banana_bread",
  "recipe_A": "apple_cake_545366",
  "recipe_B": "banana_bread_23078",
  "tree_dot_code": "digraph G {...} ",
  "tree_novelty_score": 63.357,
  "recipe_title": "Caramel Banana Spice Cake",
  "recipe_ingredients": ["1 loaf banana bread, sliced", "1/2 cup brown sugar", ...],
  "recipe_instructions": ["In a small saucepan, heat the brown sugar over low heat until it is warm...", "Arrange the sliced banana bread...", ...],
  "full_recipe_text": "Title: Caramel Banana Spice Cake\n\n Ingredients: ...\n\n Instructions: ...",
  "recipe_summary": "Caramel Banana Spice Cake is a decadent dessert featuring layers of banana bread, spiced cake, and rich caramel flavors...",
  "recipe_element_novelty_score": [["mascarpone", 7.121], ["distribute", 5.764], ...],
  "recipe_novelty_score": 77.439,
  "picked_1st_exp": false, 
  "picked_2nd_exp": false
}
```
In addition to the core fields:
* `recipe_A` / `recipe_B`: IDs of the original recipes that were recombined
* `tree_dot_code`: DOT-format graph representing the recombined recipe tree 
* `tree_novelty_score`: novelty score of the recombined tree
* `recipe_title` / `recipe_ingredients` / `recipe_instructions`: extracted recipe fields for convenience
* `recipe_element_novelty_score`: a sorted list of the elements (ingredients and actions) that contributed most to the recipe’s novelty score

Note that the tree novelty score and the recipe novelty score may differ (as during the translation from the recombined tree into natural-language recipe, the LLM fills in missing details and corrects inconsistencies, which can introduce or remove elements and thus change the final novelty score).


### Other Data Files

The `data/` folder also includes the prompt variations curated for both experiments:
* `prompt_variations_1st_exp.csv`
* `prompt_variations_2nd_exp.csv`

These files list all prompt variants used in our experiments. As described in the paper, culinary experts evaluated the recipes generated by GPT-4o using these variants. Their assessments determined the best-performing prompts, which were then used for the final GPT-4o prompting.

Additionally, the folder includes a zipped directory named `exp_recipes/`, containing all recipes used to evaluate our model against GPT-4o.
